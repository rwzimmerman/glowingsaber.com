                <p> The primary reason for this web sit is not to share gaming content, it is to learn some tech skills.  I am an IT professional, 
                    but I don't do very much web devlopment and I'd like to learn more about AWS.  I figured the best way to larn more about these 
                    things would be to build a website using 'serverless' on AWS about something I really enjoy.  I'll list some of the tech I've
                    used to build this sit as well as some of the resources I used to figure out how to do it.
                    </p><br><br>


                <p class="h2">HTML and Scripting</p>
                <p> When I started this project I only knew the very basics of HTML, like what a href was and what CSS did, but had little to no
                    experience using them.  While I have a lot of scripting experience, I had never writen a web page that included a script.
                    Here are some of the resources I liked most when learning about HTML.
                </p>
                <p> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">w3schools.com</a> - w3schools not only serves as a great refernece the
                    the documents are layed out as a tutorial.  I've been through the HTML, CSS and JQUERY tutorials.  Each lesson has an easy to
                    use attached lab as well.  Fantastic site!
                </p>
                <p> <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">You Dont Know JS</a> - This is a great site with an on-line in-depth 
                    Java Scripting manual.
                </p>


                

                <p class="h2">Git</p>
                <p> Prior to this project I've never uses any sort of source control.  Git has been a great tool to manage the code for this site
                    I've also been experimenting with keeping some of my other scripts here as well.
                </p>

                <p> <a href="https://github.com/rwzimmerman">GitHub</a> - This is a link to my github.  All of the code for this site
                    is stored in the glowingsaber.com repository.  
                </p>

                <p> <a href="https://githowto.com/">githowto.com</a> - This is great tutorial for learning how to use the command line for github.
                    Most if it is written for linux.  I'm primarial a Windos user, but had not trouble following along.
                </p>


                <p class="h2">AWS</p>
                <p> I work with AWS professionaly, but there are hundreds of different services offered and  I can't justify spending work time on 
                    all the ones I'd like to play around with.  So this website gives me goals that help me understand AWS services in a much better
                    capacity than if I'd just run through a tutorial I found on-line.'

                <p> <a href="https://sanderknape.com/2017/05/building-a-serverless-website-in-aws/">Sander Knape Blog</a> - This blog entry is a
                    step-by-step on how to build a serverless website in AWS using S3, DynamoDB, Lambda and API Gateway.  This is how I learned to 
                    set up my first database backed page and a bit about JQuery.
