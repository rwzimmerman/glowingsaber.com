                <p>This is my personal rules reference. It is not a FAQ, nor is it intended to tell anyone how the game should be played.</p>
                <p>This page is so I can reference it when running tournaments, allowing me to quickly see how I’ve resolved rule questions in the past and why I made that decision.  I’ve also added a few other references like an index for timing rules.</p>
                <p>I hope others find it helpful.</p>

                <p class="Question"> Q) Do 'when damaging' effects happen when a model is killed?</p>
                <p class="Answer"> A) Yes. When damaging effects happen when damage is applied.  The model dies and is removed immediately after that except in the case After Damaging triggers which delay the removal of the model. </p>
                <p class="Reference"> Reference: <a href="http://themostexcellentandawesomeforumever-wyrd.com/topic/131554-sun-quiangs-king-of-medicine-on-a-dying-model/">Sun Quiang's King of Medicine on a dying model </a></p>
    
                <p class="Question"> Q) In what order are the effects of an Action or an Ability resolved? Can other abilities take place in the middle of the Action/Ability? </p>
                <p class="Answer"> A) The effects are resolved in the order they are written. Other Abilities can take place before the Action/Ability is fully resolved. If an Alp, for example, would hit an enemy model with Kiss Goodnight, the enemy model would first suffer damage from the Attack and only after that gain slow and suffer damage from Feed on Dreams. All of this would happen before after failing defensive triggers, for example.  </p>

                <p class="Question"> Q) What suits are considered "associated with a stat" for abilities like the Freikorps Librarian's Nether Fluxuations?  </p>
                <p class="Answer"> A) Suits that are built into the models skill as well as any suits added to the stat from any other trait is considered associated with it.

                <p class="Question"> Q) Does the red joker have a suit when it is revealed, for traits like Lynch's Cheating Bastard?  </p>
                <p class="Answer"> A) When the Red Joker is flipped or played, the owning player must immediately announce which suit the Red Joker will be during the Action.  When a card is revealed it is not flipped or played, so the suit selection does not occur.   </p>

                <p class="Question"> Q) The rulebook defines Abilities, Attack Actions and Tactical Actions, but Lady Justice's Justice Unleashed upgrade lists two Tactical Actions as Abilities.  Are they treated as Abilities or Tactical Actions?  </p>
                <p class="Answer"> A) They are treated as Tactical Actions. There are several cards where a Trait has been mislabeled. Justing Gibbs - the lead game desinger at time - stated Ophelia's the Tactical Actions
                                   on her card that were mislabeled Attack Actions are considered Tactical Actions. Most of these mislabeeings (including Justice Unleashed) have been quitely corrected; there is no errata, 
                                   but more recent versions of the cards label the Traits correctly. Same answer for similar mislabelings.   </p>
