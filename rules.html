            <p>This is my personal rules reference. It is not a FAQ, nor is it intended to tell anyone how the game should be played.</p>
            <p>This page is so I can reference it when running tournaments, allowing me to quickly see how I’ve resolved rule questions in the past and why I made that decision.  I’ve also added a few other references like an index for timing rules.</p>
            <p>I hope others find it helpful.</p>

            <p class="h2">Timing</p> <br>

            <p class="Question"> Q) Do 'when damaging' effects happen when a model is killed?</p>
            <p class="Answer"> A) Yes. When damaging effects happen when damage is applied.  The model dies and is removed immediately after that except in the case After Damaging triggers which delay the removal of the model. </p>
            <p class="Reference"> Reference: <a href="http://themostexcellentandawesomeforumever-wyrd.com/topic/131554-sun-quiangs-king-of-medicine-on-a-dying-model/">Sun Quiang's King of Medicine on a dying model </a></p>

            <p class="Question"> Q) In what order are the effects of an Action or an Ability resolved? Can other abilities take place in the middle of the Action/Ability? </p>
            <p class="Answer"> A) The effects are resolved in the order they are written. Other Abilities can take place before the Action/Ability is fully resolved. If an Alp, for example, would hit an enemy model with Kiss Goodnight, the enemy model would first suffer damage from the Attack and only after that gain slow and suffer damage from Feed on Dreams. All of this would happen before after failing defensive triggers, for example.  </p>

            <p class="Answer"> A) Yes, the model can choose to the option to apply the condition, but they will not gain the condition. </p>

            <p class="Question"> Q) Is a model considered to gain a condition if it is immune to that condition?  </p>
            <p class="Answer"> A) No  </p>

            <p class="Answer"> A) The player with the lower card. Though initiative flips are not duels, forum consensus has been to treat them as duels when appropriate. If there is a tie the First player from the previous turn must cheat first.   </p>

            <p class="Question"> Q) If a crew that can cheat initiative does so and it results in a tie, can initiative be cheated again?   </p>
            <p class="Answer"> A) No, though initiative flips are not duels, forum consensus has been to treat them as duels when appropriate. In a duel you may only cheat once.   </p>

            <p class="Question"> Q) What suits are considered "associated with a stat" for abilities like the Freikorps Librarian's Nether Fluxuations?  </p>
            <p class="Answer"> A) Suits that are built into the models skill as well as any suits added to the stat from any other trait is considered associated with it. Suits added to the duel (e.g. Freikorpsman's Reference the Field Guide) or to the card flipped are not considered to be associated with the stat.   </p>

            <p class="Question"> Q) Does the red joker have a suit when it is revealed, for traits like Lynch's Cheating Bastard?  </p>
            <p class="Answer"> A) When the Red Joker is flipped or played, the owning player must immediately announce which suit the Red Joker will be during the Action.  When a card is revealed it is not flipped or played, so the suit selection does not occur.   </p>

                               on her card that were mislabeled Attack Actions are considered Tactical Actions. Most of these mislabeeings (including Justice Unleashed) have been quitely corrected; there is no errata, 
                               but more recent versions of the cards label the Traits correctly. Same answer for similar mislabelings.   </p>

            <p class="Question"> Q) Does an Activation caused by Marcus’ Alpha work the same way as any other Activation?  </p>
